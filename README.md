# Dynamic Clock Using Javascript
JavaScript can be executed in time-intervals.  This is called timing events.
# Timing Events
The window object allows execution of code at specified time intervals.

These time intervals are called timing events.

The two key methods to use with JavaScript are:

setTimeout(function, milliseconds)
Executes a function, after waiting a specified number of milliseconds.

setInterval(function, milliseconds)
Same as setTimeout(), but repeats the execution of the function continuously.
The setTimeout() and setInterval() are both methods of the HTML DOM Window object.
# The setTimeout method()
> window.setTimeout(function, milliseconds);

The window.setTimeout() method can be written without the window prefix.

The first parameter is a function to be executed.

The second parameter indicates the number of milliseconds before execution.
# How to Stop the Execution?
The clearTimeout() method stops the execution of the function specified in setTimeout().

> window.clearTimeout(timeoutVariable)
The window.clearTimeout() method can be written without the window prefix.

The clearTimeout() method uses the variable returned from setTimeout():
> myVar = setTimeout(function, milliseconds);
> clearTimeout(myVar);

If the function has not already been executed, you can stop the execution by calling the clearTimeout() method:

# The setInterval method()
The setInterval() method repeats a given function at every given time-interval.

> window.setInterval(function, milliseconds);
The window.setInterval() method can be written without the window prefix.

The first parameter is the function to be executed.

The second parameter indicates the length of the time-interval between each execution.

This example executes a function called "myTimer" once every second (like a digital watch).
# How to Stop the Execution?
The clearInterval() method stops the executions of the function specified in the setInterval() method.

> window.clearInterval(timerVariable)
The window.clearInterval() method can be written without the window prefix.

The clearInterval() method uses the variable returned from setInterval():

> let myVar = setInterval(function, milliseconds);
> clearInterval(myVar);
